# Appium Inspector: Basic Usage Guide

## 1. What is Appium Inspector?

**Appium Inspector** is a GUI tool that allows you to inspect the structure of your mobile app's UI and identify UI elements to automate using Appium. It shows the hierarchy of UI elements, allowing you to find locators like ID, XPath, accessibility ID, etc.

### Key Features:
- View and interact with UI elements in a live mobile session.
- Generate XPath or other locators for your automation tests.
- Test and interact with elements using Appium commands.

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Appium server**: Make sure Appium server is installed and running.
- **Connected device/emulator**: You need a real device or emulator (Android or iOS) connected to your system.

## 3. Installing Appium Inspector

1. Download the latest version of **Appium Inspector** from [here](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases).
2. Follow the installation instructions for macOS, Windows, or Linux.

## 4. Launching Appium Inspector

### 4.1 Start Appium Server
Before using the Inspector, ensure that Appium Server is running:
```bash
appium
```
Appium runs by default on `http://localhost:4723`.

### 4.2 Open Appium Inspector
1. Open the **Appium Inspector** application.
2. You'll see a screen to configure the connection to the Appium server and set the desired capabilities.

## 5. Configuring Appium Inspector for Android or iOS

### 5.1 Desired Capabilities Setup
In Appium Inspector, you need to provide **desired capabilities** to connect to your device or emulator. Below is a sample configuration:

#### Android Example:

| Key                | Value                |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| platformName       | Android              |
| deviceName         | Your_Android_Device  |
| app                | /path/to/app.apk     |
| automationName     | UiAutomator2         |

#### iOS Example:

| Key                | Value                |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| platformName       | iOS                  |
| deviceName         | iPhone_Emulator      |
| app                | /path/to/app.app     |
| automationName     | XCUITest             |

Once you've added the desired capabilities, click **Start Session** to launch the Inspector.

## 6. Inspecting Elements

After connecting to the app, the Inspector window will display the app's UI hierarchy. Here's how to inspect and use the tool:

### 6.1 Hierarchy Tree
- The left panel shows the **element tree** (a hierarchy of UI elements).
- You can explore the hierarchy by expanding and collapsing nodes.

### 6.2 Selecting Elements
- Click on any element in the app's UI on the right side, or choose an element from the hierarchy tree on the left.
- This will display the element’s details such as **attributes** like `ID`, `class`, `text`, `content-desc`, etc.

### 6.3 Finding Locators
Once you click on an element, you will see various attributes in the center of the Inspector, including:

- **ID**: For `findElementById`.
- **XPath**: For `findElementByXPath`.
- **Accessibility ID**: For `findElementByAccessibilityId`.

### Example:
If you click on a button, you may see the following information:
- Resource ID: `com.example:id/buttonLogin`
- XPath: `//android.widget.Button[@text='Login']`
- Accessibility ID: `loginButton`

You can copy these locators directly into your Appium test scripts.

## 7. Testing Interactions with Elements

### 7.1 Running Appium Commands
In the bottom panel, you can test actions directly from the Inspector without writing code. Choose an action like `click()`, `sendKeys()`, or `clear()`, then select the element to interact with.

### Example: Sending Text to a Text Field
1. Select a text field element in the hierarchy.
2. In the Appium Inspector, choose `sendKeys()` from the dropdown.
3. Enter the value (e.g., `"hello world"`).
4. Click **Execute** to see the action performed on the mobile app.

## 8. Exporting Element Locators

Appium Inspector allows you to generate code snippets for the locators you find. Here's how you can do it:

### 8.1 XPath Generation
Click on an element, and in the Inspector, the corresponding **XPath** will be displayed. You can copy this and use it in your Appium scripts:

```java
MobileElement loginButton = driver.findElementByXPath("//android.widget.Button[@text='Login']");
```

### 8.2 Exporting Code
Appium Inspector provides a feature to export element interaction code:
1. After selecting an element, you’ll see a small **code** icon next to the locator.
2. Click it to generate code snippets for different programming languages like Java, Python, etc.

Example in Java:
```java
driver.findElementById("com.example:id/buttonLogin").click();
```

## 9. Debugging with Appium Inspector

### 9.1 Debugging Actions
If a locator isn’t working, Appium Inspector lets you test actions like clicks or input before committing them to your scripts. This can save time in debugging.

### 9.2 Taking Screenshots
Appium Inspector allows you to take screenshots of the app in its current state:
1. Click on the **camera** icon in the Inspector interface to capture the app’s current view.
2. The screenshot will be saved to your local machine.

## 10. Common Use Cases

### Example 1: Finding and Clicking a Button
1. Use Appium Inspector to locate the button by its `resource-id` or `text`.
2. Copy the XPath or ID.
3. In your Java test:
```java
MobileElement loginButton = driver.findElementById("com.example:id/buttonLogin");
loginButton.click();
```

### Example 2: Entering Text in a Field
1. Select a text input field in the Inspector.
2. Copy its locator (e.g., `resource-id`).
3. In your Java test:
```java
MobileElement inputField = driver.findElementById("com.example:id/inputText");
inputField.sendKeys("hello world");
```

## 11. Closing the Session

Once you’re done inspecting elements, click **Stop Session** to disconnect from the mobile device.

## 12. Conclusion

Appium Inspector is a powerful tool to inspect your app’s UI, find element locators, and test commands interactively before adding them to your automation scripts. It simplifies the process of identifying elements and debugging issues in mobile automation.
